//! Shared actuation command/feedback contracts.
//!
//! These types are intentionally runtime-agnostic so the same message model can
//! be used with in-process gateway workers, child actors, or remote transports.
//!
//! ## Vocabulary by boundary
//!
//! | Layer | Types | Terms | Role |
//! |-------|--------|-------|------|
//! | **Actor / controller runtime** | [`ActuationCommand`], [`ActuationFeedback`], [`FsmEvent`] | **ACK / NACK** | What the twin and actuation port speak |
//! | **Physical ingress** ([`TwinIngressEvent`]) | `FrontHeadlampCommandConfirmed`, `FrontHeadlampCommandRejected` | **Confirmed / Rejected** | Bus decode → semantic outcome before projection |
//!
//! [`ActuationFeedback`] is **actor-side**: correlated responses on the actuation port
//! (future channel or child-actor path). Gateway CAN ingress today maps wire ACK/NACK into
//! physical **Confirmed/Rejected**, then projection maps those into [`FsmEvent::FrontHeadlampOnAck`]
//! / `OffAck` or `ActuationIncomplete { cause: NegativeAck }` — not into [`ActuationFeedback`] yet.
